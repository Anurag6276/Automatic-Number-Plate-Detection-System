# Automatic-Number-Plate-Detection-System
This project implements an automated system for detecting and recognizing vehicle license plates from images using OpenCV and Tesseract OCR. The system processes the input image to detect contours, isolates the license plate, and extracts the text using Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
